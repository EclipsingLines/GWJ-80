### LLM Disclaimer

This project uses LLMs for accelerated development.
The human creator of this project emphatically rejects AI slop and truly believes that Large Language Models can be effectively used to enhance and empower all types of software developers.

This project used AI to help generate planning documents and code following a strict set of rules.
About 50%~70% of the code in this project was written by an LLM.
