# Godot Game Development Quickstart Checklist

This checklist provides a step-by-step guide for initializing a new game development project using the "gd template" and ensuring the creation of comprehensive game brain documents, a Game Design Document (GDD), and a Game Technical Document.

## Usage

As a AI coding assistant, your objective is to follow this checklist to help the user create the necessary documents for sucessful game development.

You will go step by step and ask the user questions to guide the creation of these document, encouraging the user to describe the game they want and translating these into actionable designs.

It is more efficient to write some of these documents in parallel, the documents created here should be considered living documents, meaning that the results of this quickstart guide will be a FIRST DRAFT that you and the user will continue to iterate on during development. Refer to `prompt.md` for understanding the overall workflow and the role of the AI assistant.
